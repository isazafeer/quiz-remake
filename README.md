**Quiz-Remake**

In this week's challenge, I have been tasked with creating a quiz using javascript.

This has been my most challenging task yet, as programming with Javascript is something that I have not engaged with before. 

Although the commits show that I have only spent one day on this project, I have been working on this challenge most of the week. I created a new repository to start from scratch as my previous repository was riddled with numerous HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.

**I do want to note that while this is my 2nd attempt, it is my first submission.**

Here is a list of commits from my previous attempt.

Firstly, there were several challenges that I faced during this project. A couple of them being Javascript, linking questions, and only using one of each file type.

After some additional support and independant research, I was able to overcome some of these issues and present my project. The main challenge I faced was implementing the use of a timer. This was a hurdle for me as I was able to implement it in my current project. In my previous attempt, I used a start button on a seperate HTML page to redirect the user to the 'game.html' page. 

Another obstacle was the use of local storage. This took several attempts and independant research to overcome.
